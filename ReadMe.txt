1. Navigate to the mine
2. Equip only the hardhat
3. Click on your own penguin and keep the character menu in the top right of the screen 
(this makes sure that the program doesnt break if the script accidentally clicks on another penguin)
3. Snap club penguin to the right side of the screen

this script will only run properly if you are using google chrome on a 1920x1080 monitor with club penguin snapped to the right side of the screen
